Description

    This project features JavaScript Object Oriented programming.
    The code including the game engine and images were cloned from
    GitHub leaving skeleton classes and missing functionality. I
    implented the classes and added new functionality.

    The player moves about the canvas playing grid using arrow keys.
    The player avoids collisions with the enemy bugs. However, if
    a collision occurs, the player is sent back to starting position.
